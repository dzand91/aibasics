It\nthen sends structured requests to remote\nagents.\n\u0000 A2A Server (Remote Agents) \nReceive the Request Each remote AI agent\ninterprets the request, processes it, and\nreturns data (e.g., available flights, prices).\nUser\n A2A Client\nA2A Server\nInitiate Request\nRequest Action\nProcess TaskReturn\nResultKey Concepts in A2A 5.\n@Dzan Dedukic\nKey Concepts in A2A 5.\n\ud83d\udd39 Fundamental Elements of A2A\n\ud83c\udccf Agent Card \u2013 A JSON metadata file that\ndefines an A2A Server\u2019s identity, capabilities,\nendpoints, and authentication methods. \ud83d\udd39  Think\nof it like an AI agent\u2019s profile page\u2014it tells other\nagents what it can do and how to interact with it.\n\ud83d\udee0 Task \u2013 A unique, stateful unit of work (e.g.,\n\u201cgenerate report\u201d). \ud83d\udd39  Just like a work order at a\ncompany, it tracks progress through stages:\nsubmitted \u2192 working \u2192 completed \u2192 failed.\n\ud83d\udcac Message \u2013 The core communication unit\nwithin a Task. \n\ud83d\udd39 Similar to emails in a project, it carries\ninstructions, context, or responses exchanged\nbetween agents.\n\ud83d\udce6 Part \u2013 Content pieces inside Messages or\nArtifacts (text, files, structured data). \n\ud83d\udd39 Think of it as an email attachment\u2014supporting\nthe main message with extra details.\n\ud83d\udcdc Artifact \u2013 Outputs generated by agents\u2014\ndocuments, images, or data files. \n\ud83d\udd39 Like a final report in a business project, it\u2019s the\ncompleted deliverable often streamed\nincrementally for real-time updates.\nKey Concepts in A2A 5.\nAgent Card\nWhat I can do..\nHow to interact..Task\nBasic Unit of Work..\nHas Lifecycle...\nMessage\nThe core communication\nunit within a TaskArtifact\nOutputs or final results\nproduced from Task\nPart\nContent pieces within \nMsgs or Artifacts\n@Dzan Dedukic\n\u2714 MCP (Model Context Protocol) \u2192 \nConnects AI agents to structured tools &\nexternal resources \n\u2714 A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) \u2192 \nEnables AI agents from different providers to\ncollaborate & exchange information\n\u2699 Why Two Protocols?\n\ud83d\udee0 MCP \u2192 AI Agents Using Tools \n\ud83d\udd39 Connects agents to structured APIs,\ndatabases & predefined functions \n\ud83d\udd39 Works best for single request-response\ninteractions\n\ud83e\udd1d A2A \u2192 AI Agents Collaborating \n\ud83d\udd39 Standardizes communication between\nindependent, opaque AI agents \n\ud83d\udd39 Allows for multi-step workflows, task\ndelegation & negotiationHow MCP & A2A Work\nTogether6.\nHow MCP & A2A Work\nTogether6.\nAn agent-driven system can leverage A2A for seamless\ncommunication between AI agents, while each agent relies\non MCP to efficiently access and operate its specialized tools\nand resources.Source\n\u0000 A Disaster Strikes\nA major earthquake has hit a city, and aid\norganizations need immediate coordination to\nassess damage and send help.\n\u0000 A Human or Organization Makes a Request\n(A2A Starts Here)\nA rescue coordinator contacts an AI Disaster\nResponse Manager: \n\ud83d\udcac \u201cWe need to assess damage and organize\nemergency medical support.\u201d\n\u0000 The Disaster Response AI Takes Action\nThe AI Disaster Response Manager realizes it needs\nmultiple specialized AI agents to help: \n\u2714 Damage Assessment AI \u2013 To analyze destruction\nlevels. \n\u2714 Medical Logistics AI \u2013 To coordinate supplies and\nemergency teams. \n\u2714 Transport AI \u2013 To optimize delivery routes.\nThese agents all communicate with each other\nusing A2A, sharing real-time updates.How MCP & A2A Work\nTogether: Example6.\n\u0000 AI Agents Request Tools & Data (MCP Starts\nHere)\nEach agent uses MCP to connect with external tools\nand retrieve key information: \n\u2714 Damage Assessment AI \u2192 Requests satellite images\nto assess impact. \n\u2714 Medical Logistics AI \u2192 Checks medical supply\navailability in nearby warehouses. \n\u2714 Transport AI \u2192 Finds the fastest, safest delivery\nroutes for aid trucks.\n\u0000 AI Agents Share Updates & Coordinate\nResponses (A2A in Action Again)\n\u2714 The Damage Assessment AI sends an update:\n\u201cSevere damage detected in Zones A & B\u2014hospitals\nimpacted.\u201d \n\u2714 The Medical Logistics AI responds: \u201cDeploying\nsupplies to affected hospitals.
